SqueezeRemote
=============

A Basic SqueezeBox command line remote

Living in a shell most of the time coding Perl, and listening to music from my Squeezebox, I wanted something that give me basic control over some functions while in a crude terminal interface.

I Plan to have this installable as a CPAN like module, but that is a long way away, as I just need something to work and work well.
